## Improvements / WIP:
- I still need to find a creative way to make the layout responsive while still maintaining some of the same themes.
- I would like to look into other word generating APIs or possibly make my own random word API to generate better art prompts and ensure that the words returned are formatted correctly and fully appropriate.
